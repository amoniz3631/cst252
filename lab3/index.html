	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure </h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p>The basic goal of this lab is to develop a structure within Atom, so that our folders are well
		 organized and easily managed/navigated. The other half of this lab covers setting up basci file
		 structure in the form of summarizing our lab.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p1>I think the main challege of this lab was trying to set up a file from the ground up. I've been
			trying to work on not copying and pasting structure from other labs and just changing the
		 	content. I just want to work on building my file structure from scratch.</p1>
