	<h1>Lab 4 - File Transfer </h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p> The subject of this lab is to get into the habit of pseudocodong before we start actually coding to keep our code neat and understandable.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p1>I only ran into two small issues. The first was misunderstanding the assignment. I thought I needed to fill in the code that my pseudocode outlined which would have been difficult because I don't know JavaScript yet. The second was pasting the lists into my HTML. I had a difficult time formatting them. Scroll bars would appear around them, so I opted to just take screenshots and link the images. </p1>
