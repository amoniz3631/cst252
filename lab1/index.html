 <section><h2>About Me</h2>
 <p class="summary"> Hello there! My name is Ariana, but I prefer to go by Ari! I am a third year here at CSUMB and my major is communication design! I really enjoy playing video games and my favorite right now is <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> I really enjoy doing makeup, though I really am a lazy person by nature and most times don't want to get up early to get ready. I currently work at the Zumiez in the Del Monte cetner and enjoying skating and tattooing in my free time! </p></section>
